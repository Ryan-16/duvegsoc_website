Infamously, tofu has gained a reputation for being soggy, flavourless, and difficult to get right. I find this incredibly ironic given that tofu is actually one of the most versatile vegan foods out there. Due to its naturally bland taste, which we’ve all heard a few too many jokes about, it takes on any flavour you want to give it, meaning it works well in basically any dish. It might seem difficult to get the hang of at first, especially since it’s a food many new vegans have never encountered before, but with just a little bit of practice you’ll be making amazing tofu in no time. While there are hundreds of potential tofu recipes out there, here is a very simple beginners’ guide!

**Why tofu?**

Tofu, a food made from curdled soy milk, has become a staple of many vegan and plant based diets. Relatively low in calories, tofu is high in protein and often fortified with B12, making it an easy source of two of the key nutrients which can be difficult to get on a vegan diet. Additionally, as meat substitutes go (though tofu is of course a food in its own right rather than simply a ‘substitute’), tofu is relatively inexpensive and readily available in most major supermarkets. 

**So what do I do with it?** 

***Start by selecting your tofu.*** In most supermarkets there are three main types available: silken tofu, firm smoked tofu, and firm plain tofu. Silken tofu is best for ramen dishes and tofu scrambles, while firm tofu, the more popular variety in the UK, holds its shape better so is easier to grill or fry for use in pasta dishes, stir fries, and other similar dishes. Smoked tofu, as the name would suggest, already has a smoky flavour so requires less preparation in general, while the plain tofu is best if you want to use your own marinade. With this in mind, select the tofu that best suits your needs. The following steps have firm tofu in mind as this is easier to find in the UK and likely what you’ll be using. 

***Press your tofu.*** You’ll first need to press out any extra liquid to make sure it continues to hold its shape while cooking. This also allows the marinade to fully soak in, resulting in tastier tofu. While you can buy tofu presses online, I tend to just wrap the tofu in some kitchen role, place it on a chopping board, and pile some recipe books on top; slightly rough and ready, but it still gets the job done. You can press tofu from anywhere between ten minutes to several hours (I usually leave mine for about fifteen minutes). 

***Prepare your marinade.*** If you’ve bought plain tofu, marinating it is essential to making sure your desired flavour fully soaks in. There are hundreds of potential marinades out there, but let's start with two easy ones: 
* ***For Asian or Asian inspired dishes:*** Soy sauce, rice vinegar, chilli flakes, ginger 
* ***For Italian or Italian inspired dishes:*** Olive oil, lemon juice, basil, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika 
Decide which marinade best suits the dish you have in mind. Feel free to experiment and play around with different flavours here. Then, chop your tofu into the desired shape and coat it in the marinade; leave for several hours. If you’re like me and often forget to plan this far ahead, thirty minutes will do in a pinch. I often use the leftover marinade as stir fry sauce or salad dressing depending on the flavours to cut down on food waste. 

***Decide on your desired texture.*** If you want a crispier tofu, it helps to toss the tofu in cornflour before cooking. I often do this if I’m using smoked tofu which I haven’t marinaded, tossing it in cornflour, smoked paprika, salt and pepper. You can also add garlic and onion powder, or any other combination depending on the desired taste. If you want a softer texture, feel free to skip this step. 

***Bake or fry?*** You’ve now arrived at the final step: it’s time to actually cook the tofu. It’s possible to both oven bake and fry your tofu. Frying is much quicker and allows meals to come together slightly easier, while oven baking may be healthier if you’re trying to cut down on oil but takes much longer. Either one will result in a delicious meal; I’d recommend trying both and then deciding which you prefer. 

**What now?**

Now you’ve mastered the basics of making tofu taste good, there’s a whole world of tofu available to you. You can make tofu scrambles, vegan ricotta and other soft cheeses, creamy pasta sauces, vegan fish fingers, burgers... the possibilities are endless! Hopefully this blog post can help you on your way and open your eyes to the versatility of this food, and in no time you’ll be making the vegan food of your dreams. Happy cooking :)
