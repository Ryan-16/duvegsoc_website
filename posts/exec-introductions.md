## Charlie Wilson - President
### 3rd Year / Physical geography
#### Why did you become veggie/vegan? 
I originally became vegetarian when I was ~ 14. I did it
for the animals as I could no longer stomach how inhumane it felt to eat animal. Then
around a year before I came to university, I became vegan as I learnt more online about how
the dairy industry was just as cruel. But the real tipping point for me becoming vegan was
learning about the huge environmental damage/pollution of animal agriculture.
#### What was your familyâ€™s reaction when you first became veggie/vegan? 
My family werenâ€™t
surprised when I became vegetarian, in fact they were surprised I hadnâ€™t become veggie
sooner. However, my dad said I could only go veggie if I cooked all my own meals, so thatâ€™s
exactly what I did. Going vegan was a little different. My mum was very supportive as she
was already vegan; my dad wasnâ€™t as supportive. I think he was worried that it wasnâ€™t a
healthy lifestyle, but now that he sees Iâ€™m still alive and healthy as a vegan heâ€™s totally cool
with it.
#### What is your favourite go-to meal? 
Veggie chilli â€“ itâ€™s actually my dadâ€™s recipe and he makes
it 100 x better than I ever could.
#### What do you hope to achieve with VegSoc this year? 
Iâ€™m really aiming to build a community
and raise awareness to the wider university about why going veggie/vegan is one of the best
things we can do for the planet!
#### What fruit or vegetable best describe your personality? 
I feel like I would be a pear because
theyâ€™re severely underrated

## Ryan Lail - Treasurer
### 3rd Year / Computer Science
#### Why did you become veggie/vegan? 
Studying animal rights in GCSE R.E. really made me really think about why I was consuming animal products, if they weren't necessary and many live without them.
#### What was your familyâ€™s reaction when you first became veggie/vegan? 
Initially slightly hesistant, but it eventually grew on them!
#### What is your favourite go-to meal? 
2 Greggs Vegan Sausage Rolls with a side of Vegan Steak Bake ðŸ¥§.
#### What do you hope to achieve with VegSoc this year? 
To try and provide a sense of community during the pandemic!

## Gracie Linthwaite - Secretary
### 2nd Year / English Literature
#### Why did you become veggie/vegan? 
I originally became vegetarian when I was 15 as one of my New Yearâ€™s resolutions; I made a deal
with myself to try it for a week, which then became a month, and I ended up never going back. At
first my motivation was primarily nutrition related, as I had read that cutting out meat leads to a
healthier diet, but after studying animal ethics as part of my R.S A-level the moral ramifications
became the most important reason. From then on I slowly transitioned to veganism, first by
switching to soy milk, then cutting out eggs, and finally waving goodbye to cheese after a visit to
Wensleydale Creamery; the imagery of a smiling cow plastered around their cafe seemed to me
completely at odds with what really goes on in the dairy industry, and made me realise how food
companies contribute to peopleâ€™s cognitive dissonance when it comes to consuming animal
products.
#### What was your familyâ€™s reaction when you first became veggie/vegan? 
Growing up, my mum was vegetarian and we would regularly have meat free meals, so I donâ€™t
think it was particularly surprising that I would eventually go vegan. At first my grandma was
concerned that I wouldnâ€™t get enough vitamins and nutrients on a vegan diet, but Iâ€™ve assured her
that this isnâ€™t the case! She even bought me a vegan cookbook one Christmas since I tend to do
most of the cooking when Iâ€™m at home. My dad is very supportive too and is happy to eat vegan
food with me, although he will (somewhat) jokingly ask me where the meat is in any dish I make!
#### What advice would you give to anyone starting out with veganism?
Donâ€™t aim for perfection straight away; transitioning to a vegan lifestyle can be a big change and
may take time. You will inevitably make mistakes, whether thatâ€™s forgetting to check the back of a
food label or buying shoes made of leather without even thinking about it. All you can do is your
best, and that is more than good enough.
#### What is your favourite go-to meal? 
Tomato and lentil pasta: its quick, cheap and easy, and Iâ€™ve always got the ingredients for it in my
cupboard. Since James Acaster suggested adding dark chocolate to Bolognese on Celebrity
Pointless, I have been adding a few dark chocolate buttons to make the sauce extra rich!
#### What do you hope to achieve with VegSoc this year? 
Iâ€™m really excited for the new Book Club to get up and running, as well as the diverse selection of
Veg talks we have planned this year. Iâ€™m hoping that we can demonstrate as a society that
veganism not only has ethical and environmental benefits, but is a healthy and student-budget
friendly lifestyle too!
#### What fruit or vegetable best describes your personality?
A satsuma because Iâ€™m cheerful, easy going and happy to travel anywhere!

## Innes Orr - Welfare
### 2nd Year / Education Studies with Psychology
#### Why did you become veggie/vegan? 
My sister started together so that our parents would allow us too.
#### What was your familyâ€™s reaction when you first became veggie/vegan? 
Very accommodating actually.
#### What advice would you give to anyone starting out with veganism?
Make sure you eat enough food and Morrisonâ€™s has the best vegan chocolate.
#### What is your favourite go-to meal? 
Jacket sweet potato with marinated tofu.
#### What do you hope to achieve with VegSoc this year? 
To help people to find other like minded people and make friends as uni can be quite daunting, especially in these times.
#### What fruit or vegetable best describes your personality?
Parsnip because itâ€™s underrated.

## Marie Stobbart - Recipe Coordinator
### 2nd Year / Geography
#### Why did you become veggie/vegan? 
I became vegan for the animals!
#### What was your familyâ€™s reaction when you first became veggie/vegan? 
They were quite worried about protein and not getting all the vitamins, but theyâ€™re a lot more chill about it
now that they understand it a bit more!
#### What advice would you give to anyone starting out with veganism?
Donâ€™t feel guilty about not cutting everything out immediately, or about having cravings. Little steps will
make the change to veganism easier and make the temptations less strong in the long run.
#### What is your favourite go-to meal? 
My favourite go to meal is (very basic) pasta with tomato and basil sauce.
#### What do you hope to achieve with VegSoc this year? 
I hope to help spread more awareness and education about veganism and animal rights.
#### What fruit or vegetable best describes your personality?
Tangerine because itâ€™s one of my favourite songs;)

## Lydia Griffin - Campaigns and Outreach
### 4th Year / Behavioural Science
#### Why did you become veggie/vegan? 
I first became veggie when I was 15/16 â€“ but I didnâ€™t really eat much meat before. I never really liked it and I always felt uneasy as I could never separate the piece of meat on my plate from an animal. I was then on/off vegan when I was 19/20 and Iâ€™ve been vegan now for a year! Iâ€™m definitely an â€˜ethicalâ€™ or â€˜moralâ€™ vegan â€“ I do it for the animals. I find it really hard to understand why the horrific treatment of farm animals is an accepted part of our society and felt like a hypocrite that my diet didnâ€™t reflect my beliefs! This definitely sustains my veganism but as a by-product I now have a much healthier diet (I really enjoy cooking!) and I am aware of the environmental implications of my decisions! It is really great to know that my carbon footprint is reduced and that I lead an overall healthier lifestyle. 
#### What was your familyâ€™s reaction when you first became veggie/vegan? 
As I am from a countryside town, meat was an accepted part of my familyâ€™s diet growing up. I donâ€™t think my family really understood my decision to go vegan, often referring to me being on a â€˜high horseâ€™ just because I didnâ€™t want to contribute to the industry. I often got questioned/dragged into debates where I would have to defend my decision to be vegan, but as time has gone on my family are really accepting of my choice to be vegan and have even altered their diets to reduce meat and animal products! They understand now that it is a healthier lifestyle which is better for your heart and body, and have been really accommodating with my diet choices.
#### What advice would you give to anyone starting out with veganism?
Donâ€™t kick yourself if you have something that isnâ€™t vegan, or really fancy that pizza or chocolate. It is a strange transition that does take time, and you might not be vegan all the time. Anything is better than nothing and once you start making small changes to your diet you will realise how easy it is! 
The alternatives out there are so great now that you actually have choice when you go out for a meal or go to the supermarkets! Also, it doesnâ€™t have to be expensive. There is often a stereotype around vegan lifestyles that it is expensive and unaffordable, and sometimes the meat alternatives can be pricey, but supermarkets own brands are way more affordable and â€˜vegetable mealsâ€™  are super cheap. 
My friend once told me that being vegan is about minimizing cruelty as much as you can and sometimes you will have to take medications for mental illness, period products or other health conditions that were tested on animals or not vegan. This is okay. It doesnâ€™t mean that you are not vegan. Veganism shouldnâ€™t come at your own expense, itâ€™s about navigating it all and maintaining a healthy, cruelty-free lifestyle.
#### What is your favourite go-to meal? 
Sweet potato and spinach curry! It is super easy and cheap to make, and you can bulk make it so you have plenty of portions to go at! I also add a dollop of peanut butter into the sauce that makes it extra creamy and tasty.
#### What do you hope to achieve with VegSoc this year? 
â€™m really excited about these blogs, to help show everyone who VegSoc are and help to improve our outreach! I hope to reduce the stigma around veganism and show how wholesome everyone in VegSoc are. I am also super excited to be the Durham rep for The Humane League and helping to further their campaigns to help improve the conditions of farm animals!
#### What fruit or vegetable best describes your personality?
A pepper because I took a buzzfeed quiz and I got a pepper so a pepper it is!
