This vegan lemon drizzle is my go-to if I'm short on time and need to impress guests. It is a one bowl recipe and it is so quick to make (takes 15 minutes to mix). I found that it has the most perfect texture of all the lemon drizzles I have made and you don't need any fancy flax-eggs or bananas to replace eggs.

Ingredients:
* 75 ml vegetable oil 
* 200 g caster sugar
* 250 g plain flour
* 220 ml plant milk 
* 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
* 1 pinch of salt 
* Juice of half a lemon
* Zest of 1 lemon 

To decorate: 
* 2 tbsp caster sugar 
* Juice of 2 lemons
* 200 g icing sugar


Method:
1. Preheat the oven to 170C. Grease or line a loaf ti
2. Mix the vegetable oil and sugar together in a large bowl. 
3. Add in the lemon zest, flour, bicarbonate of soda, salt and milk. Beat together with a wooden spoon to combine. 
4. Stir in the lemon juice.
5. Spoon into the prepared loaf tin and place in the oven for 35-45 minutes until golden and cooked through (you can test this by inserting a metal skewer into the centre of the cake – if it’s cooked, it should come out clean).
6. Mix together the caster sugar and 2 tbsp of the lemon juice. Poke several holes in the hot cake and spoon over the sugar-lemon mixture. Leave to cool in the tin.
7. Once cool, remove from the tin.
8. Place the icing sugar in a bowl and add half of the remaining lemon juice. Stir with a whisk until combined. Add more lemon juice as required until you have a thick drizzle.
9. Spoon the icing mixture over the cake.
