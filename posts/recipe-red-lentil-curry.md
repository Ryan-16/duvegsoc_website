If I could recommend one vegan recipe to anyone as we enter 2021 it would most likely be this creamy, absolutely mouth-watering lentil curry from Rainbow Plant Life. Itâ€™s one of those dishes that shocks me every time I make it, how it always tastes more delicious than before! Itâ€™s also very simple to follow - so get your red lentils and spices and get cooking! Pop some raw spinach or broccoli (or anything else green ðŸ˜‰) on the side and youâ€™re good to go!

It also freezes really well, so is perfect for making in bulk ahead of a busy week ðŸ˜Š

Ingredients:
* 1 tbsp refined or virgin coconut oil, or a neutral-flavored oil
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and minced or grated
* 1 tsp ground turmeric
* 1-2 serrano peppers, diced 
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1/2 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 2 tsp curry powder
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 1 cup (180-190g) red lentils
* 2 cups (480 mL) vegetable stock
* X 1 can chopped tomatoes
* X 1 can coconut milk
* 3 tbsp almond butter
* 1/2 a small lemon, juiced
* 1/2 cup fresh corriander, roughly chopped
* For serving: Basmati or Jasmine rice and Indian flatbread such as roti, paratha, or naan


Method:
1. Rinse the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear.
2. Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat and add the coconut oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the garlic, ginger, and Serrano pepper and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent garlic from burning.
3. Add the cumin, coriander, chili powder, curry powder, garam masala, turmeric, salt, and black pepper to taste, and cook for 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant, tossing frequently to prevent burning. 
4. Pour in the vegetable stock, and use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. 
5. Add in the lentils and the crushed tomatoes and mix well. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan with a lid. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through and have mostly softened.
6. Remove the lid and stir in the coconut milk, almond butter, along with salt and pepper to taste. Continue cooking on low heat, uncovered for 5 to 8 minutes, until the curry has thickened and is creamy. 
7. Finally, stir in the lemon juice and cilantro, and turn off the heat.
8. Serve the curry with rice and/or flatbread. Store leftovers in the fridge for 3-4 days.

Eat and Enjoy!
