In October 2019 I made the decision to stop eating meat completely and go vegetarian, something which seemed incredibly alien to me at the time. It was an idea that I’d been toying with for some time, but the concept of never eating meat again was one I struggled to get my mind around. I thought I’d miss my burgers too much or that bacon butties were too irresistible to turn down. I thought that I’d lose all my ‘gains’ in the gym and not be able to continue progressing with my strength training. Although, I found out that, once I’d made the switch to vegetarianism, I didn’t miss meat all that much!
 
When a vegetarian/vegan friend would bring up their dietary choices, I would say, “Well on, but I could never give up meat… I’d miss eating burgers.”, or something along those lines. I believed it would be too difficult to give up meat, as I had grown up with it my whole life- it just seemed normal. The thing I didn’t realise was just how easy it was to start; I simply swapped out meat for the nearest vegetarian/vegan option. For example, I LOVE burgers (if you couldn’t tell already!). There are a range of different plant-based alternatives, with Beyond Meat, the Impossible Burger, Tesco’s Plant Kitchen, Linda McCartney, the list goes on!
 
Classic meals like stir fries or a spaghetti Bolognese could easily be made without meat, switching in a plant-based alternative such as Oumph! pieces and Tesco’s vegan mince. Truth be told, this is how I still eat today, I find it to be the most sustainable way of eating if you’ve ever expressed the “I could never give up meat!” mindset. This way of eating has been pretty simple and pretty affordable to keep up with.
 
I think one of the most difficult things to contend with was the notion that meat makes one somehow more masculine and that a bloke that ate plants wasn’t as “manly” as one that ate steak. This was certainly the sentiment I received from some people! However, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Once people get over the initial shock, the novelty wears off and it just becomes a given that you don’t eat meat. In my experience, even the people that threw a few jabs at me here and there were more than respectful of my decision after a few weeks.
 
I was also a bit worried about how the switch to a more plant-based diet would affect my training in the gym, which I think is really common! How could I drink protein shakes? Would my strength all of a sudden diminish? There are a bunch of great vegan protein brands, MyVegan (a subsection of MyProtein) being one of them- they also do a great student discount. My strength didn’t tragically disappear, even after months of not eating meat; I just made sure I was eating healthily and that I was getting enough of protein, carbs and fats.
 
To sum up, as someone who had previously seen the whole idea of veganism/vegetarianism as completely foreign and have the idea that they could never give up meat, I’d say it’s really easier than we think! Opting for a more plant-based diet doesn’t mean you’re going to be eating salad for the rest of your days, or that you’ll never be able to pick up a 10 kg dumbbell again. It’s a great idea if you want to try something new, be more environmentally conscious, or save the animals. If you’ve been wanting to try it for a while but have said “I could never give up meat”, perhaps give Veganuary a go and see how you feel!
