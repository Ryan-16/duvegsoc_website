Serves: 6-8, depending on the size of the squashes

I came up with this recipe in order to use up a tin of chickpeas I had in my cupboard, but it
quickly developed into something more than a simple chickpea curry. By combining the
sweetness of the roasted squash and corn with the savoury pepper and spices, it creates an in-
depth flavour that doesn’t need a huge amount of heat to be tasty, making it a curry that can
be enjoyed by anyone, no matter how much spice they like.
All of the spice measurements are fairly approximate and can be altered as you wish to
change the flavour. If the squashes you use are particularly large, you may need to use more
spice than indicated here.

Equipment:
* Deep, wide baking tray
* Deep saucepan or wok

Ingredients:
* 1 tin chopped tomatoes
* 1 onion – diced
* 2 cloves garlic – crushed
* 1 tbsp ginger – grated
* 1 tin chickpeas – drained
* 2 butternut squashes – peeled, seeds removed, chopped into chunks
* 10 baby sweetcorn (or 1 pack) – chopped into chunks
* 2 green peppers – chopped into chunks
* ½ tsp chilli powder
* 1 tsp ground turmeric
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 2 tsp Thai 7 spice
* A pinch of cumin seeds (if you don’t have cumin seeds, ground cumin works fine too)
* Vegetable oil, salt and pepper

Method:
* Pre-heat the oven to 200°C.
* Place the squash in the baking tray with the oil, salt and pepper. Roast it for 30-40
minutes until soft and beginning to fall apart.
* Around 7 minutes before taking the squash out, heat up the oil and the cumin seeds in
the saucepan or wok at a medium heat for around 2 minutes.
* Add the onion, garlic and ginger to the pan and stir fry until the onion is translucent
and beginning to brown.
* Add the tomatoes, chickpeas and squash to the pan, then stir to combine and simmer
for approximately 5 minutes.
* Add the spices to the pan, then stir and taste, adding more spices if required.
* Add the pepper and baby corn and stir to combine. Cook until the peppers and corn
are beginning to soften but still retain their crunch.
* Serve with rice.

Eat and Enjoy!
